## Overview
This project (a Shiny app) was submitted as the final assingment for the Coursera course Developing Data Products.


- The application can be accessed via: https://asafilian.shinyapps.io/OzonePredict_TempWind/ 

- The source codes (**ui.R** and **server.R**) can be found in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/asafilian/Shiny_Airquality_Project 

 
## The Dataset
The **airquality** dataset from the **datasets** package was used: 
```{r, comment="", echo=TRUE}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
airquality <- airquality[complete.cases(airquality),]
str(airquality)
```

## The Application
- <font size="4">Select a prediction model from the radio button. </font> 
- <font size="4">Choose your desired value from the corresponding slider.</font>  
- <font size="4">The app will show an appropriate plot with the corresponding linear model.</font>  
- <font size="4">Moreover, it will predict the Ozone quality based for your choice.</font>
